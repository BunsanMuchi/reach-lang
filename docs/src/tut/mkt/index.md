# {#tut-mkt} Marketplace

## {#tut-mkt-introduction} Introduction

This tutorial teaches how to create a safe application for two `{!rsh} Participant`s, `Seller` and `Buyer`, to transact business.

:::note
A `{!rsh} Participant` in this context refers to anyone participating in a particular transaction. 
In other words, a `{!rsh} Participant` is a user.
:::

The following image is a pictorial description of how the application will work at the end of this tutorial.

> **Insert Image Describing the flow of transactions**

This tutorial begins with building a basic DApp, grows into an interactive command-line interface application, and concludes with a web application.

By the end, you will have learned:

1. How `Reach` command-line DApps work.
2. How to use the `Reach` standard library.
3. Concepts such as `{!rsh} Participant`s, Reach `{!rsh} type`s, variable declaration, variable definition, and steps.
4. How a Reach Web App works.

## {#tut-mkt-prerequisites} Prerequisites

It is assumed that you have installed Reach. 
If you need help installing Reach, refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/#quickstart).

## {#tut-mkt-starter} Starter Code

This section will guide you on how to create the basic code for this project.

1. Create a folder named `market` in your `Reach` directory:

```reach
mkdir market
```

2. Change the working directory to `market`.

```reach
cd market
```

3. Create 2 files: `index.rsh` and `index.mjs`.

```reach
touch index.rsh index.mjs
```

* `index.mjs` is the frontend of the DApp containing the code that the `{!rsh} Participant`s will `{!rsh} interact` with.

* `index.rsh` is the backend that contains the DApp's instructions and ensures the security of the DApp.
This is where the `Reach` code is written.

### {#tut-mkt-starter-backend} Backend

In `index.rsh`, type out the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.rsh
md5: 0db2f196a40225069c9728319be85434
range: 1 - 7
```

This code doesn't do anything yet, but it is an important foundation for code later in the tutorial. 
Many `Reach` projects begin with this structure.

* Line 1 tells `Reach` how to compile or run the DApp.
Without it, you will get an error.

* Line 3 declares a `commonInteract` `{!rsh} object`. 
This will hold properties that are common to the `seller` and `buyer`.

* Line 5 declares a `sellerInteract` `{!rsh} object`.
 The `seller` can access all the properties that go into the `sellerInteract`.

* Line 7 declares a `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} object`.
 It contains everything that the `buyer` can do during this transaction.
 
 ```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.rsh
md5: 0db2f196a40225069c9728319be85434
range: 9 - 19
```

* Lines 9 and 19 are the start and end of the main export from the program. 
Only the code within this block is compiled. 

* Lines 10 to 13 define a `{!rsh} Participant` (i.e. `Seller`) and give the `{!rsh} Participant` access to the `commonInteract` and `sellerInteract` properties.

* Lines 14 to 17 define another `{!rsh} Participant` (i.e. `Buyer`) and give the `{!rsh} Participant` access to the `commonInteract` and `buyerInteract` properties.

* Line 18 is used to execute the program.
Without it, the program will never start.

### {#tut-mkt-starter-frontend} Frontend

Next, let's work on the `index.mjs` file. 
Type the code below:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.mjs
md5: b5f8b9b475567605d7b0ae7a52b93d46
range: 1 - 6
```

* Line 1 imports `{!rsh} loadStdlib` from the Reach standard library.

* Line 2 imports the `./build/index.main.mjs` file as the backend.
This file doesn't exist yet.
It will be automatically generated when you run `{!cmd} ./reach run` in your terminal.

* Line 3 calls the `loadStdlib` function that was imported on line 1 and the output is stored as `stdlib`.

* Line 5: The `Seller` sets up a contract for the program.

* Line 6: The `Buyer` attaches to the contract.

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.mjs
md5: b5f8b9b475567605d7b0ae7a52b93d46
range: 8 - 17
```

* Lines 8 to 17 is an asynchronous block that is used to execute the frontend code.

* Lines 9 to 12 execute the `Seller`'s contract on the `Seller`. 
The `Seller` is also given access to `commonInteract` and `sellerInteract` properties. 

* Lines 13 to 16 execute the `Buyer`'s contract on the `Buyer`. 
The `Buyer` is also given access to the `commonInteract` and `buyerInteract` properties.

The code that you have just written forms the basis for the DApp that is to be built.

Notice that `commonInteract`, `buyerInteract`, and `sellerInteract` are similar in both the backend and frontend files. 

This is because `Reach` requires knowing how the variables will be used before they are referenced. 
The program exits with an error if those variables are not used the way they were declared.
So these variables are declared at the backend before being defined in the frontend. 

This might feel like a lot of work especially if you are coming from a language like JavaScript that is weakly typed.
However, it is better to use a language with stronger security, especially when dealing with money and trust.

### {#tut-mkt-starter-review} Review

In this section, we created the basic code for the application that this tutorial plans to build.

Two (2) important files were created and the necessary code was added. 
See the full code [here]().

Next, a simple DApp will be built. 
This will help you to visualize how the finished product will be designed.

Time to proceed!

## {#tut-mkt-basic} Basic DApp

In this section, a basic DApp will be created with only essential functionality. 
By the end, you will see how a basic Reach command-line DApp works.

### {#tut-mkt-basic-why} Why Build This Basic DApp

A `seller` relocates to an area where there is high demand for the goods he sells. 
He enjoys a monopoly in the market and soon realizes that he has more `buyer`s than he can handle.
He also finds out that the method he has been using to transact business is not secure enough as the business grows.

He then decides to hire someone to build an application that will allow him to transact business with little or no supervision. 
Since he is new to this technology and enjoys a monopoly, he decides he needs a simple DApp that gives no autonomy to him or the `buyer`. 
Once he and a `buyer` agree to transact business, the DApp picks a good that both parties must agree to transact upon.

You have been contracted to build this application and you follow these steps to successfully build the application:

### {#tut-mkt-basic-declare} Declare Variables

Enter the following code just before the  `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 3 - 11
```

These are constants that will help in building the `commonInteract`, `sellerInteract` and `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`. 

* Line 3: `choice`. 
This is an `{!rsh} integer` that represents the `product` that the `buyer` decides to order.

:::note
An integer is represented by `{!rsh} UInt`. 
:::

* Line 4: `quantity`. 
This is an `{!rsh} integer` that represents the quantity of the `product` that the `buyer` orders.

* Line 5: `announcement`. 
This is a `{!rsh} String` that will represent a short advertisement made by the `seller`. 

:::note
A string is represented by `{!rsh} Bytes(28)`.
The integer in braces (28) defines the maximum length of the string.
:::

* Lines 6 to 11: `product`. 
This is an `{!rsh} Object` that contains the properties (i.e. key-value pair) of each product that the `seller` has in stock for sale.

* Line 13: `products`. 
This is an `{!rsh} Array` of `product`s offered by the seller. 

Now that those variables have been declared, we need to flesh out the `commonInteract`, `sellerInteract` and `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`s.
These are the steps:

For the `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object`, replace this code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.rsh
md5: 0db2f196a40225069c9728319be85434
range: 3 - 3
```

with this code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 14 - 25
```

* Lines 14 to 25: `commonInteract`.
This will hold properties that will be accessible to both the `seller` and `buyer`.

* Lines 15 to 24: `showResult`.
 This is a `{!rsh} function` that takes in two (2) `{!rsh} Object`s and returns nothing.

:::note
A `{!rsh} function` in Reach is defined as `{!rsh} Fun([input], output)`.
:::

Remove this code for the `sellerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.rsh
md5: 0db2f196a40225069c9728319be85434
range: 5 - 5
```

Enter this code instead:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 27 - 33
```

* Lines 27 to 33: `sellerInteract`.
 This will hold all properties accessible to the `seller`.

* Lines 28 to 31: `sellerInfo`.
 This is an `{!rsh} Object` that will contain the `announcement` and `products` that were declared on lines 5 and 13 respectively.

* Line 32: `reportReady`.
 This is a `{!rsh} function` that takes in the `announcement` and `products` and returns nothing.

Clear this code for the `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.rsh
md5: 0db2f196a40225069c9728319be85434
range: 7 - 7
```

Type in this code instead:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 35 - 37
```

* Lines 35 to 37: `buyerInteract`.
This will hold all properties accessible to the `buyer`. 

* Line 36: `shop`.
 This is a `{!rsh} function` that represents the buyer's process in looking through the `seller`'s `products` and deciding which one to pick and how many are needed.
 It takes in an `Object` of the `seller`'s `announcement` and `products`. 
 It then returns an `Object` containing the `buyer`'s `choice` and `quantity`.

That is all that needs to be done in the backend for now. 
Now we need to define the frontend.

### {#tut-mkt-basic-accounts} Create Accounts
In the [previous section](##tut-mkt-starter-frontend), contracts were setup for the `{!rsh} Participant`s:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-1-starter/index.mjs
md5: b5f8b9b475567605d7b0ae7a52b93d46
range: 5 - 6
```

:::note
A contract is the same as a written agreement that must be signed by all `{!rsh} Participant`s before any transaction can take place.

Deploying a contract is the act of creating the terms of participation. 
This is done by the `{!rsh} Participant` who initiates the transaction.

Attaching to a contract is agreeing to the terms of participation. 
It is just like signing a physical paper contract that was handed over to you.

This project will have the `seller` deploy the contract while the `buyer` will attach to it.
:::

These contracts require that each of the `{!rsh} Participant`s have an account set up before entering the contract.

:::note
Having an account is like having a book that keeps track of the activities of a particular user. 
It holds information such as name, remaining money, and history of transactions.
The DApp uses that record to manage the user while using the application.

For example, a user's account balance would help the DApp know if the user is eligible to complete a transaction or not.
:::

Just before the contracts, type the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.mjs
md5: d5bb7b565a6c62e13856e735d8ace111
range: 5 - 8
```

* Line 5 sets up some funds that can be used by each `{!rsh} Participant` as starting balance.
`{!rsh} parseCurrency` converts the figure passed into it to an acceptable currency on a DApp.

:::note
The `{!rsh} parseCurrency` `{!rsh} function` is a built-in method that transforms fiat currencies (such as USD, EUR and GBP) into currencies used to transact on a DApp.
Currencies used in a DApp include ETH and ALGO.
:::

* Lines 7 and 8 create an account for each of the `{!rsh} Participant`s.
This is for test purposes. 

With these accounts, the contracts will now work as expected.

### {#tut-mkt-basic-define} Define Variables
Now that the uses of the variables are declared, these variables will now be given their proper functionalities.

Just below the contracts, enter the following code for the `sellerInteract`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.mjs
md5: d5bb7b565a6c62e13856e735d8ace111
range: 13 - 30
```

* Line 13 defines `sellerInteract` as an `{!rsh} Object`.

* Lines 14 to 21 defines the `sellerInfo` as an `{!rsh} Object`.

* Line 15 passes a `{!rsh} string` to the `announcement` variable.

* Lines 16 to 20: The details of each `product` are passed into the `products` `{!rsh} Array` as `{!rsh} Object`s.
It is a list of items that the `Seller` puts up for sale with their properties.

* Lines 22 to 29 creates a  `{!rsh} function` named `reportReady`. 
The `{!rsh} function` takes in `announcement` and `products` as arguments.

* Line 23 logs a `{!rsh} string` to the console.

* Lines 24 to 28 obtain the contract information, which is an `{!rsh} Object`, and log it to the console as a JSON string.
You can see this as the seller's unique identifier.

That is all that the `Seller` needs for this section.

The next code is for the `buyerInteract`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.mjs
md5: d5bb7b565a6c62e13856e735d8ace111
range: 32 - 47
```

* Line 32 defines `buyerInteract` as an `{!rsh} Object`.

* Line 33 defines `shop` as a `{!rsh} function`. It takes the `sellerInfo` as an argument.

* Line 34 logs the `Seller`'s `announcement` to the console.

* Lines 35 to 39 loop through the `Seller`'s `products` and list them for the `Buyer`.

* Line 41 gets a random number not more than `4`.
This number, stored as `choice`, represents the position of an item in the `products` array.
So if the `choice` is `2`, then the `product` chosen will be 
`{ name: "Corn", unit: "ear", units: "ears", price: "5" }`

* Line 41 picks the `quantity` of that `product` for the `Buyer`.
This is also a random number that is not more than `100`.

* Line 43 displays the `name` of the selected product.

* Line 45 returns the `decision` (i.e. the `choice` and `quantity`) of the `Buyer`.

That completes the `buyerInteract`. 

Finally, type the code below for `commonInteract`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.mjs
md5: d5bb7b565a6c62e13856e735d8ace111
range: 49 - 61
```

All `{!rsh} Participant`s will have access to this code.

* Line 49 defines `commonInteract` as a `{!rsh} function` that takes in `person` as an argument.

* Line 50 defines `showResult` as a `{!rsh} function` that takes in `decision` (returned on line 45) and `sellerInfo` as an argument. 

* Lines 51 to 59 log to the console the details of the `product` that the `Buyer` has decided to purchase.
The same `product` is also logged to the console as the `product` that the `Seller` has decided to sell.

A more detailed breakdown of the code:

i. `${person === "Seller" ? "sell" : "buy"}` means if the `${person}` is `Seller`, display `sell` else display `buy`.

ii. `${decision.quantity}` is the `quantity` that the `Buyer` wants out of the original quantity of the `product`.

iii. `${decision.quantity > 1 ? sellerInfo.products[decision.choice].units : sellerInfo.products[decision.choice].unit}` is either the `unit` or `units` of the product the `Buyer` chose. 
This is dependent on the `quantity` that the `Buyer` wants.

iv. `${sellerInfo.products[decision.choice].name}` is the name of the product that the buyer chose.

That seals the frontend for this section.
Just one more step! 

Go back to the backend file.

### {#tut-mkt-basic-connect} Connect Frontend to Backend

This stage is the last one for the basic DApp. 
It will make the backend to `{!rsh} interact` with the frontend and that in turn, will log outputs in the console.
To make that happen, all the methods that have just been defined in the frontend, will now be called upon using the `{!rsh} interact` `{!rsh} Object`.

:::note
Calling `{!rsh} interact` on something in Reach is the same thing as calling upon a `{!rsh} function` to execute the code within it.
:::

Go back to the backend file. Just below `{!rsh} init();`, type the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 50 - 55
```

This is called a `{!rsh} local step`. 

:::note
A local step is an action that happens on the `{!rsh} Participant`'s machine. This step is used to execute codes that are only accessible to a particular `{!rsh} Participant`.
:::

* Line 50 calls the `{!rsh} only()` method on the `Seller`.

* Line 51 has the `Seller` `{!rsh} interact` with the `sellerInfo` `{!rsh} Object`. 

After the `{!rsh} interact`ion is done, the program is then permitted to share whatsoever the result of that `{!rsh} interact`ion is with the public. 
To do this, `{!rsh} declassify()` method is used.

:::note
`{!rsh} declassify()` is a Reach method used to make any secret `{!rsh} publish`able or shareable with other `{!rsh} Participant`s.
:::

* Line 53 now publicizes the `sellerInfo` that has been declassified.

* Line 54 then `{!rsh} interact`s with the `Seller`'s `reportReady` `{!rsh} function`. 
The `reportReady` takes in two arguments (i.e. the `Seller`'s `announcement` and `products`)

* Line 55 concludes the `Seller`'s local step by calling `commit()`.

Now, doing a `{!cmd} ./reach run` in the terminal will show some output.
That concludes the `Seller`'s interaction.

Next, type in the following code for the `Buyer`'s interaction:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 57 - 61
```

This is the `Buyer`'s local step

* Line 57 calls the `{!rsh} only()` method on the `Buyer`.

* Line 58 has the `Buyer` `{!rsh} interact` with the `shop` `{!rsh} function`. 
The result of that interaction is also declassified. 

* Line 60 publicizes the `decision` from line 58.

* Line 61 concludes the `Buyer`'s steps with a `commit();`

Finally, the result of the program is shown with the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-2-basic/index.rsh
md5: f077a4aea0733cb5632fd35522287267
range: 63 - 63
```

* Line 63 executes the `showResult` `{!rsh} function` on both `{!rsh} Participants`.

In the terminal, execute `{!cmd} ./reach run`.
An output similar to what's printed below should display.

```
Welcome to the Market
Contract info: {"type":"BigNumber","hex":"0x6d"}
List of products for sale:
1. Potatoes at 10 per bag.
2. Carrots at 10 per bunch.
3. Corn at 5 per ear.
Buyer wants Potatoes
Buyer agrees to buy 9 bags of Potatoes
Seller agrees to sell 9 bags of Potatoes

```

:::note 
`{!cmd} ./reach run` was executed 3 times to the 3 different outputs that you see above.

You get one result each time that you execute `{!cmd} ./reach run`.
:::

This is a beautiful start. 
You just created a simple DApp that completes a simple transaction.

### {#tut-mkt-basic-Review} Review
This section taught the basics of the Reach language and demonstrated how the final DApp to be built will work.
You learned that:

* A `{!rsh} Participant` is a user.

* An integer is represented by `{!rsh} UInt`. 

* A string is represented by `{!rsh} Bytes(x)`.
The integer (x) in braces defines how long the string may be.

* A `{!rsh} function` in Reach is defined as `{!rsh} Fun([input], output)`.

* `{!rsh} parseCurrency` `{!rsh} function` was provided by Reach to help convert regular currencies (such as USD, CAD and Naira) into currencies acceptable on a DApp (such as ETH and ALGO).

* Calling `{!rsh} interact` on something in Reach is the same thing as calling upon a `{!rsh} function` to execute the code within it.

* A local step is an action that happens on a `{!rsh} Participant`'s machine.
This step is used to execute code that is only accessible to a particular `{!rsh} Participant`.

* `{!rsh} declassify()` is used to make any secret `{!rsh} publish`able or shareable with other `{!rsh} Participant`s.

* A contract is the same as a written agreement that must be signed by all `{!rsh} Participant`s before any transaction can take place. 
The `{!rsh} Participant` that initiates the transaction deploys the contract, while the other `{!rsh} Participant`(s) attach to it.

* An account is like a book that keeps track of the activities of a particular user. 
It holds information that helps the DApp manage a `{!rsh} Participant`.

That was a good way to start building the marketplace application.
Hopefully, you found it helpful and easy to follow. 

It is important to note that Reach offers flexibility in the way code may be written. 
Check [here](../../../examples/mkt-3-basic-alt) for an optional way that the code for this section may be written.

See full code for this section [here](../../../examples/mkt-3-basic).

The next section will show how `{!cmd} ./reach run` works, how to use `process.argv`, how `{!rsh} Participant`s can interact with the DApp and how to manage money and currency.

## {#tut-mkt-interaction} Interaction and Independence
The previous section demonstrated how to build a basic Reach program. 
But more can be done with Reach than that. 

Reach offers autonomy to `{!rsh} Participant`s in a transaction.
This means that the `Seller` and the `Buyer` can decide whether or not to proceed with the transaction. 
They can also decide how they prefer that the transaction takes place.

This section will a DApp that will offer more flexibility to the `{!rsh} Participant`s.

Things to look out for in this section are:
* A detailed explanation of `{!cmd} ./reach run` works.

* What `{!rsh} process.argv` entails

* How to handle money and currency.

### {#tut-mkt-interaction-reach-run} How `./reach run` Works

The `{!cmd} ./reach run` command is used to execute whatever is in the `index.rsh` file because `index.rsh` is added to the command in the background.
Running `{!cmd} ./reach run` in the terminal will behave in the same way just as `{!cmd} ./reach run index`.

:::note
`{!cmd} ./reach run index.rsh` will throw the following error:

```reach
index.rsh.rsh doesn't exist.
```

This is because Reach adds the extension by default already.
:::

`{!cmd} ./reach run` produces an array by default. It looks like this:

```reach
[ '/usr/local/bin/node', '/app/index.mjs' ]
```

So any string added to the `{!cmd} ./reach run index` command, will be added to that array.
For example, `{!cmd} ./reach run index seller` will produce:

```reach
[ '/usr/local/bin/node', '/app/index.mjs', 'seller' ]
```

The item(s) that come after the second item in the array, tells us the variable that has been passed in.

To see this working, type the following on line 4 of the `index.mjs` file:

```reach
console.log(process.argv);
```

Run `{!cmd} ./reach run index seller` in the terminal.

The output it produces will look like this:

```reach
[ '/usr/local/bin/node', '/app/index.mjs', 'seller' ]
Welcome to the Market
Contract info: {"type":"BigNumber","hex":"0xba"}
List of products for sale:
1. Potatoes at 10 per bag.
2. Carrots at 10 per bunch.
3. Corn at 5 per ear.
Buyer wants Potatoes
Buyer agrees to buy 95 bags of Potatoes
Seller agrees to sell 95 bags of Potatoes
```

The first line of the output is the line of interest. 
That will be leveraged in giving the `{!rsh} Participant`s autonomy as the project for this section is developed.

That is the basics of how the `{!cmd} ./reach run` command works. 

### {#tut-mkt-interaction-why} Why Build An Interactive DApp

The Basic DApp has been working fine and the business has grown but the `seller` no longer enjoys a monopoly - he now has competitors. 
The `buyer`s have complained of either not getting what they want or not getting the quantity they want.

He realizes that for him to compete, he has to make transactions more flexible for the `buyer`s. 
To do this, the application must be improved.

You are being commissioned once again to improve the DApp. 
Following the steps below, the application was completed:

### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-basic} Basic Interactive DApp

We will begin with new files to make it easy to follow. 

Type the following code in the backend file:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.rsh
md5: 8b848cfcef89c59feb46b9bce2ed4535
range: 1 - 34
```

This code looks familiar. A few changes were made:

* `choice` and `quantity` have been removed.

* `commonInteract` is currently empty. 
It has also been destructured into the `sellerInteract` and `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`.
This will produce the same result as before when it was destructured inside of the `{!rsh} Participant` definition.

* `shop` `{!rsh} function` now returns an `{!rsh} Object` containing `prodNum` and `prodAmt` instead of `choice` and `quantity`.

* Since `commonInteract` has already been destructured into the `sellerInteract` and `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`, 
`sellerInteract` and `buyerInteract` was passed to the `{!rsh} Participant` definition without destructuring.

* Finally, `Seller` and `buyer` has been changed to `S` and `B`.

That's all for the backend for now.

In the `index.mjs` file, type the code below:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.mjs
md5: a3630889eeffc107acbdf70e15635ced
range: 1 - 12
```

* Line 1 imports the `{!rsh} ask` `{!rsh} Object` alongside `{!rsh} loadStdlib` from the Reach standard library.

:::note
The `{!rsh} ask` `{!rsh} Object` is used to ask questions and obtain answers from the `{!rsh} Participant`s. 
:::

* Line 3 calls on the `{!rsh} loadStdlib` `{!rsh} function` and passes the `{!rsh} process.env` as an argument.

:::note
`{!rsh} process.env` is used to access the environment variable. 
You can log it to the console to see the output
:::

* Lines 5 to 8 is a conditional statement that checks if there is no third argument passed to the `{!cmd} ./reach run` command or if the third argument passed is neither `seller` nor `buyer`.

* Line 6 logs a message telling the `{!rsh} Participant` what command to run for the program to work if line 5 evaluates to `{!rsh} true`.

* Line 7 terminates the program.

* Line 10 stores the third argument passed to the `{!cmd} ./reach run` command as `role`.

* Line 11 shows the role that the `{!rsh} Participant` chose.

* Line 12 reveals the consensus network that the `{!rsh} Participant` chose. 

:::note
A consensus network is like a bank that each `{!rsh} Participant` has decided to use to perform a transaction such as saving and transferring funds.
:::

After that, type in the following:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.mjs
md5: a3630889eeffc107acbdf70e15635ced
range: 14 - 29
```

* Line 14 accesses the standard unit through the standard library based on the consensus network and stores it as `suStr`.

* Line 15 tells the `{!rsh} Participant` what standard unit is being used.

:::note
A standard unit is the network token unit most commonly associated with a network. 
For example, the standard unit of `Ethereum` is `ETH`. 
:::

* Line 16 accesses the atomic unit through the standard library based on the consensus network and stores it as `auStr`.

* Line 17 tells the `{!rsh} Participant` what atomic unit is being used.

:::note
An atomic unit is the smallest unit of measure for the standard unit. 
It cannot be divided into smaller units.
For example, the atomic unit of `Ethereum` is `WEI`. 
:::

* Line 18 is a `{!rsh} function` that converts money from its standard unit to its atomic unit.

* Line 19 is a `{!rsh} function` that converts money from its atomic unit to its standard unit.

* Line 20 sets up a standard unit balance of 1000.

* Line 21 displays the standard unit balance.

* Line 22 converts the standard unit balance to its atomic unit.

* Line 23 shows the atomic unit balance.

* Line 24 converts the atomic unit balance back to the standard unit balance and displays it to the `{!rsh} Participant`.

* Line 25 is a `{!rsh} function` that returns the account balance of a particular `{!rsh} Participant`.

* Line 27 creates a test account.

* Line 29 defines the `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object`.

The code so far has defined utilities for the DApp. 
These will be helpful as we build the `seller`'s and `buyer`'s properties.

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-basic-seller} Seller

The code below executes if the `{!rsh} Participant` is the `seller`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.mjs
md5: a3630889eeffc107acbdf70e15635ced
range: 32 - 52
```

* Line 32 checks if the `{!rsh} Participant` is a `seller`

* Lines 33 to 47 looks familiar. This block defines the `sellerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`.

* Line 34 destructures the `commonInteract`.

* Lines 35 to 42 define the `sellerInfo` `{!rsh} Object`.

* Lines 43 to 46 define the `reportReady` `{!rsh} function`.

* Line 49 displays the account balance of the `seller` before the transaction begins.

* Line 50 sets up the contract for the transaction.

* Line 51 executes the contract on the `seller`. 
It also gives the `seller` access to the `sellerInteract` properties.

* Line 52 displays the account balance of the `seller` after the transaction ends.

With that line, the `seller`'s part is done.

The `seller`'s output will look like this:

```reach
Your role is seller
The consensus network is ALGO.
The standard unit is ALGO
The atomic unit is μALGO
Balance is 1000 ALGO
Balance is 1000000000 μALGO
Balance is 1000 ALGO
Your Balance is 1000 ALGO.
Welcome to the Market
Contract info: {"type":"BigNumber","hex":"0xc2"}
```

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-basic-buyer} Buyer

The code below executes if the `{!rsh} Participant` is not a `seller`.

Type the following:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.mjs
md5: a3630889eeffc107acbdf70e15635ced
range: 55 - 78
```

* Line 55 checks if the `{!rsh} Participant` is not a `seller`.

* Lines 56 to 66 define the `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`. And that also looks familiar.

* Line 57 destructures the `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object`.

* Lines 58 to 65 define the `shop` `{!rsh} function`.

* Line 68 uses the `{!rsh} ask` `{!rsh} Object` imported on line 1 to request for the contract details to be pasted in the terminal.

The `buyer`'s output at this point looks like this:

```reach
Your role is buyer
The consensus network is ALGO.
The standard unit is ALGO
The atomic unit is μALGO
Balance is 1000 ALGO
Balance is 1000000000 μALGO
Balance is 1000 ALGO
Paste contract info: 
```

* Lines 69 and 70 are executed after the `buyer` has pasted the details of the contract in the terminal.

* Line 71 attaches the `buyer` to the contract.

* Line 72 shows a success message.

* Line 73 displays the account balance of the `buyer` before the transaction begins.

* Line 74 executes the contract on the `buyer`. 
It also gives the `seller` access to the `buyerInteract` properties.

* Line 75 reveals the account balance of the `buyer` after the transaction ends.

* Line 77 ends the usage of the `{!rsh} ask` `{!rsh} Object`.

That ends the buyer's transaction.

The `buyer`'s output now looks like this:

```reach
Your role is buyer
The consensus network is ALGO.
The standard unit is ALGO
The atomic unit is μALGO
Balance is 1000 ALGO
Balance is 1000000000 μALGO

Paste contract info: 
{"type":"BigNumber","hex":"0xc2"}
Attaching to contract

2. Carrots at 100 ALGO per unit (bunch).
3. Corn at 50 ALGO per unit (ear).

```

While the `seller`'s output will look like this:

```reach

The standard unit is ALGO
The atomic unit is μALGO

Your Balance is 999.997 ALGO.
```

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-connect} Connect the frontend to the backend

To bring everything together, head back to the `index.rsh` file.
Type the following code after the `{!rsh} init` line for the `seller`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.rsh
md5: 8b848cfcef89c59feb46b9bce2ed4535
range: 36 - 41
```
The only difference here is that `Seller` has been changed to `S`. 
Every other thing remains the same.

Type the code below for the `buyer`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.rsh
md5: 8b848cfcef89c59feb46b9bce2ed4535
range: 43 - 55
```

Lines 44 and 46: `decision` was changed to `order`.

Line 47 checks if the `prodNum` is zero (0) or `prodNum` is more than the number of items for sale or `prodAmt` is zero (0).

Lines 48 and 49 `{!rsh} commit`s and `{!rsh} exit`s the program respectively if line 47 evaluates to `{!rsh} true`.

Line 51 `{!rsh} commit`s to the program if line 47 evaluates to `{!rsh} false`.

Line 54 terminates the program.

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-test} Testing

To test what has been done so far, open two terminals. 

In the first one, run `{!cmd} ./reach run index seller` 
While in the second terminal, run `{!cmd} ./reach run index buyer`

By the end of the transaction, the output received should look like the following screenshots:

For Seller:

![Seller's output for basic interactive DApp](./tut-mkt-Interaction-test-seller.png)

For Buyer:

![Buyer's output for basic interactive DApp](./tut-mkt-Interaction-test-seller.png)

> Video here

### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-advance} Advanced

Now that the `seller` can show `products` and the `buyer` can see them, we need to give the `buyer` the ability to purchase and the `seller` the ability to sell.

To do that, navigate to the backend file. 
More variables are to be declared.

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-advance-declare} Declare More Variables

Replace the `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object` with the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.rsh
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
range: 12 - 19
```

* Line 12 declares the `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object`.

* Line 13 states the `reportCancellation` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in no argument and returns nothing.

* Line 14 reveals the `reportExit` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in no argument and returns nothing.

* Line 15 talks about the `reportPayment` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in a `{!rsh} UInt` and returns nothing.

* Line 16 declares the `reportTransfer` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in a `{!rsh} UInt` and returns nothing.

* Line 17 reveals the `reportFulfillment` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in a `product` and a `{!rsh} UInt` and returns nothing.

* Line 18 states the `statusReport` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in no argument and returns nothing.

In the `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`, add the following `{!rsh} function`:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.rsh
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
range: 36 - 36
```

* Line 36 declares the `confirmPurchase` `{!rsh} function`. It takes in a `{!rsh} UInt` and returns a `{!rsh} Bool`.

That's all that is needed for the declaration of variables. 
Proceed to the frontend file.

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-advance-define} Define More Variables

The variables that have just been added to the backend file will now be defined here.

In the frontend file, replace the `commonInteract` `{!rsh} Object` with the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.mjs
md5: 2c66e28fba1c3faa073c05fec12d4045
range: 29 - 42
```

* Line 29 defines the `commonInteract` as an `{!rsh} Object`.

* Lines 30 - 32 define the `reportCancellation`. It takes in no argument.

* Line 31 logs a cancellation message to the console.

* Line 33 defines the `reportPayment` `{!rsh} function`. 
It takes `payment` as an argument and logs a message to the console confirming payment by the `buyer`.

* Line 34 defines the `reportTransfer` `{!rsh} function`. 
It takes `payment` as an argument and logs a message to the console showing that funds have been transferred to the `seller`.

* Lines 35 to 39 define the `reportFulfillment`. 
It takes in `p` (i.e. `product`) and `amt` (i.e. quantity requested by the `buyer`).

* Line 36 defines the subject (`subjectVerb`) of the message to be displayed.

* Line 36 defines the object (`directObject`) of the message to be displayed

* Line 38 logs the details of the `product` that the `seller` now owes the `buyer` to the console.

* Line 40 defines the `reportExit`. It takes in no argument.
It logs a cancellation message to the console.

* Line 41 defines the `statusReport`. It takes in no argument.
It reveals who passed the status report.

That concludes the definition of the `commonInteract`.

In the `buyerInteract`, add the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.mjs
md5: 2c66e28fba1c3faa073c05fec12d4045
range: 87 - 87
```

* Line 87 defines `confirmPurchase` `{!rsh} function`. 
It uses the `{!rsh} ask` `{!rsh} Object` to ask the `buyer` to confirm the purchase or cancel the transaction.

No more changes will be done to the frontend file. 
Like always, the frontend has to be connected to the backend file for all these to work.
Head back to the backend file.

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-advance-connect} Connect the frontend to the backend

Replace this code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-4-interaction-basic/index.rsh
md5: 8b848cfcef89c59feb46b9bce2ed4535
range: 47 - 52
```

With this:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.rsh
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
range: 55 - 62
```

* Line 55 checks if the `prodNum` (i.e. product number) entered doesn't match any product or if the `prodAmt` entered is zero (0).

* Line 56 `{!rsh} commit`s if Line 55 is true.

* Line 57 calls the `reportCancellation` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`.

* Line 58 calls the `reportExit` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`.

* Line 59 terminates the transaction by calling the `{!rsh} exit` method.

* Line 61 `{!rsh} commit`s if Line 55 is false.

Next, type the following code:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.rsh
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
range: 64 - 73
```

* Line 64 starts another `seller`'s only block.

* Line 65 calculates the total price to be paid by the `buyer` depending on the `product` selected. This is calculated by multiplying the `price` of the `product` by the quantity that the buyer wants.

* Line 67 publishes the total price.

* Line 68 ends this local step.

* Line 70 starts another `buyer`'s only block.

* Line 71 calls the `confirmPurchase` `{!rsh} function` and passes the `total` from line 65 to it.
This obtains the `buyer`'s consent and stores it as `willBuy`.

* Line 73 publishes `willBuy`

Now enter the code below:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.rsh
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
range: 75 - 82
```

* Line 75 checks if the `willBuy` is false.

* Line 76 `{!rsh} commit`s if Line 75 is true.

* Line 77 calls the `reportCancellation` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`.

* Line 78 calls the `reportExit` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`.

* Line 79 terminates the transaction by calling the `{!rsh} exit` method.

* Line 81 `{!rsh} commit`s if Line 75 is true.

Finally, the following code handles the payment and delivery if all goes well:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.rsh
md5: 9fa5772961e243c9e09c60e22d55cf40
range: 84 - 90
```

* Line 84 has the `buyer` pay the `total` into the contract.

* Line 85 calls the `reportPayment` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`s.

* Line 86 transfers the money paid by the `buyer` to the `seller`.

* line 87  calls the `reportTransfer` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`s.

* line 88  calls the `reportFulfillment` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`s.

* line 89  calls the `statusReport` `{!rsh} function` on each of the `{!rsh} Participant`s.

* Line 90 `{!rsh} commit` to the program.

And that concludes the application.

You have successfully completed an interactive command-line DApp.
Congratulations on this new feat! 

#### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-advance-test} Testing the application

### {#tut-mkt-Interaction-Review} Review

In this section, you learned that:

* The `{!cmd} ./reach run` command is used to execute whatever is in the `index.rsh` file because in the background, `index.rsh` is added to the command.
So running `{!cmd} ./reach run` in the terminal will behave in the same way just as `{!cmd} ./reach run index`.

* The `{!rsh} ask` `{!rsh} Object` is used to ask questions and obtain answers from the `{!rsh} Participant`s. 

* `{!rsh} process.env` is used to access the environment variable. 
You can log it to the console to see the output

* A consensus network is like a bank that each `{!rsh} Participant` has decided to use to perform a transaction such as saving and transferring funds.

* A standard unit is the network token unit most commonly associated with a network. 
For example, the standard unit of `Ethereum` is `ETH`. 

* An atomic unit is the smallest unit of measure for the standard unit. 
It cannot be divided into smaller units.
For example, the atomic unit of `Ethereum` is `WEI`. 

This new knowledge made it possible to build an interactive DApp. 
This is a better version of the DApp since the `{!rsh} Participant`s have been honored with the ability to make their own choice instead of being forced to accept random choices. 

The code for this section can be found below:

* [Basic Interactive DApp]().
* [Advanced Interactive DApp]().

But there is more that can be done. 
Since regular transactions happen on a GUI and not on a terminal, how can Reach enable the building of a GUI instead of a terminal application?

The next section has been designed to teach everything that you need to know about building a web application using Reach.

## {#tut-mkt-view-contract} View the Contract

This section teaches what `{!rsh} View`s are, how to use them and why they are important. 
It will build upon the [last section](##tut-mkt-interaction).

### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-what} What are Views?

`{!rsh} View`s are used to know the state of a DApp in Reach. 
They are read-only functions that can be called by other contracts, as well as off-chain.
They are set in consensus steps during application initialization, and accessed by the frontend by using the Reach standard library of the frontend language, such as JavaScript.

### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-how} How to use Views

`{!rsh} View`s are defined using the following syntax:

```reach
View(<viewName>, <viewBody>)
```

Where `viewName` is optional.

We will now add `{!rsh} View` to the program we already created to help make the concept clearer. 
It will be used to change how the `buyer` finds out about the `product`s that the `seller` puts up for sale.
Initially, we just console logged the `product`s in the terminal but we will access the `product`s from the `{!rsh} View`s method this time.

This can be done using the `{!rsh} Object` or `{!rsh} Struct` literal.
You will see reasons to use `{!rsh} Struct` as this tutorial progresses.

### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-how-object} Using Object

We will add `{!rsh} View` here using the `{!rsh} Object` literal.

#### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-how-object-backend} Backend

1. Add the following code just before the `{!rsh} init()` line:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-6-view-contract-object/index.rsh
md5: 431ce0577f26e934c0c19c23b36e7bc0
range: 42 - 42
```

This code defines the `{!rsh} View`, where the first parameter (i.e. `{!rsh} View` Name) is `Main` and the second parameter (i.e. `{!rsh} View` body) is the `sellerInfo` `{!rsh} Object`.

This means that the `sellerInfo` `{!rsh} Object` will be accessible through a `{!rsh} View` named `Main`.

2. Just below this line:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-6-view-contract-object/index.rsh
md5: 431ce0577f26e934c0c19c23b36e7bc0
range: 49 - 49
```

Add:

```reach
load: /examples/mkt-6-view-contract-object/index.rsh
md5: 431ce0577f26e934c0c19c23b36e7bc0
range: 50 - 50
```

This code adds the `sellerInfo` that was declassified on line 46 to the `{!rsh} View` that was defined on line 42.

That's all for the backend file.

#### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-how-object-frontend} Frontend

All changes in this file will be in the `buyerInteract` `{!rsh} Object`.

1. Remove the following code:

```js
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.mjs
md5: 2c66e28fba1c3faa073c05fec12d4045
range: 72 - 75
```

2. Between

```js
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.mjs
md5: 2c66e28fba1c3faa073c05fec12d4045
range: 90 - 90
```

and 

```js
load: /examples/mkt-5-interaction-reports/index.mjs
md5: 2c66e28fba1c3faa073c05fec12d4045
range: 100 - 100
```

Enter the following code:

* Line 92 logs a message to the console saying: `'List of products for sale:'`

* Line 93 logs a message to the console indicating where the `{!rsh} View` starts taking effect.

* Line 94 accesses the `sellerInfo` from the `Main` `{!rsh} View`.

* Line 95 to 97 loop through the `sellerInfo` and logs each `product`'s details to the console.

* Line 98 logs a message to the console indicating where the `{!rsh} View` ends.

That is all the change that needs to be done both in the frontend and in the code generally.

#### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-how-object-testing} Testing

Open two terminals. In the first one, 
run `{!cmd} ./reach run index seller` 
and in the second terminal, 
run `{!cmd} ./reach run index buyer`

The output you receive should look like this:

For Seller:

```reach
Your role is seller
The consensus network is ALGO.
The standard unit is ALGO
The atomic unit is μALGO
Balance is 1000 ALGO
Balance is 1000000000 μALGO

Your Balance is 1000 ALGO.
Welcome to the Market

The contract paid 300 ALGO to you.
You owe the buyer 3 bunches of Carrots.

```

For Buyer:

```reach

```

However, you will notice that it comes with a warning like the one below:

```reach
warning[RW0005]: The Object type's format is controlled by Reach; you may want to use Struct instead for external interfaces, so you can mandate and document the format.

  ./index.rsh:42:17:application

  42|   const V = View('Main', { sellerInfo: Object({ announcement: announcement, products: products }) });

For further explanation of this warning, see: https://docs.reach.sh/rsh/errors/#RW0005
```

To fix this, you need to use `{!rsh} Struct`s in defining your `{!rsh} View`s instead of `{!rsh} Object`s.
That is what we will be doing next.

### {#tut-mkt-view-contract-how-struct} Using Struct

We will now re-write the `{!rsh} View` using `{!rsh} Struct`.
This will help get rid of the warning.
